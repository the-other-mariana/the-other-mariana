Hi. I like to code. I can feel how my brain eases its itch when I code, and I really like the feeling. So I enjoy learning about new technologies with which I can fun with. <br />

I especially enjoy coding with math, that moment of finding the special case that helps you describe generality. Anyway, coding has a lot of branches and I am currently learning web development and anything I can find on my way.<br />

In my spare time I am a passionate fan of football. I like any team that plays beautifully. <br />

I am from Mexico and I live there as well. Although, I had the chance to live in Zagreb, Croatia for a while, and I think Majka Hrvatska stole my heart.<br />
